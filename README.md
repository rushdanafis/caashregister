# Cash-Register


Welcome to the Cash Register App! This application is designed to help you calculate the amount of change to be returned to a customer after a purchase. Simply enter the bill amount and the cash given, and the app will calculate the notes to be returned in different denominations.

## How to Use the App

1. Open the Cash Register App.

2. Enter the **bill amount** in the input field. This is the total cost of the items purchased by the customer.

3. Enter the **cash given** by the customer to pay for the bill.

4. Click on the "Calculate" button.

5. The app will display the amount of change to be returned to the customer in the form of different denominations.

6. The app will provide the optimal distribution of notes to minimize the number of notes used.

7. You can try different bill amounts and cash given values to see how the change amount varies.

## How the Calculation Works

The Cash Register App uses a simple algorithm to calculate the change amount. It first checks if the cash given is sufficient to pay for the bill. If the cash given is less than the bill amount, it will display an error message.

If the cash given is greater than or equal to the bill amount, the app will calculate the change amount. It starts by finding the difference between the cash given and the bill amount. Then, it calculates the number of notes to be returned in different denominations (e.g., $1, $5, $10, $20, etc.) to make up the change amount.

The app provides the most efficient way to distribute the notes, using higher denominations whenever possible to reduce the number of notes used.
